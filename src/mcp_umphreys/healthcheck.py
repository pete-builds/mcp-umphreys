"""Health check used by the Docker HEALTHCHECK directive.

Hits the dedicated ``/health`` route exposed by ``build_server``. That route
is intentionally separate from ``/mcp``: a bare GET against ``/mcp`` makes
the MCP SDK mint a transport session before it returns 400/405/406, and
nothing ever reaps it, leaking ~40 KB per probe at the standard 30s
interval. ``/health`` never touches the transport, so this check gates on
the 200 status code only, never the body, so the response shape can evolve
without breaking the Docker HEALTHCHECK.
