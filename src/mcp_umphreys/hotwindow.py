"""Hot-window decision: read a show live from ATU, or from the vault.

A show is "hot" for a configurable window around when it happens; hot shows are
read live (the setlist is still being typed into allthings.umphreys.com during
and just after the show) and cold shows are served from the normalized vault.

The window is anchored to the END of the show's calendar day in US Eastern, not
to midnight UTC of the show date. A US-evening show plays in next-day UTC and
ATU finalizes its setlist the following morning, so a midnight-UTC anchor made
the show ~25h "old" by the time the band took the stage and closed the window
exactly when a live read was needed.

Originally observed on mcp-phish 2026-07-07 (Kohl Center) and fixed there. The
identical inline anchor survived in mcp-umphreys until this port: 0 of 11 shows
between 2026-06-21 and 2026-08-08 scored live, every one resolving the next
morning off the 06:30 vault cron instead of during the show.
